# Image-Denoising
_How can we use neural networks to denoise images?_

_Furthermore, how good are the U-Net and Autoencoder models at denoising images?_

>  Image noise is random variations of brightness or colors in images. Noise can be caused by a number of factors, like: poor lighting conditions, a high ISO (a camera's sensitivity to light), long exposure times, heat, and more.

<h5> 
  In this study, Alex and I tested the U-Net and Autoencoder models for Image Denoisingâ€”a task in computer vision problem that seeks to remove noise from an image in order to yield a cleaner result. 
</h5>

We implemented our own U-Net and Autoencoder models (**our code can be found in image-denoising.ipynb**), and compared them qualitatively and quantitatively: we used the MNIST dataset to evaluate the denoising performance for both networks. Our results can be found in our report: **Image_Denoising.pdf**
